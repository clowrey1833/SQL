#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

#6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT f.Product, SUM(f.Quantity), f.price*f.Quantity AS total_revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
WHERE f.location = '548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101';

#7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT COUNT(distinct c.acctnum), AVG(f.Quantity * f.price) FROM BIT_DB.FebSales f
